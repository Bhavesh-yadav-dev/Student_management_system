### 🌐 Architecture Overview

Below is the layout showing how the frontend interface interacts with the live backend server:

```text
Frontend (Vercel)
[https://your-app.vercel.app](https://your-app.vercel.app)
          │
          │ fetch()
          ▼
Backend (Render)

          │
          ▼
Express API

## ⚠️ Current Limitation

Student data is stored in **memory**, so all data is lost whenever the server restarts.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🗄️ MongoDB integration
- 🔐 JWT Authentication
- 🔍 Search students
- 📄 Pagination
- ✅ Form validation
- 📱 Better responsive UI
- 📊 Sorting & Filtering
